Exercise 27 (and Solution)

The next logical step is to deal with handling user input.
When a player (say player 1, who is X) wants to place an X on the screen, they canâ€™t just click on a terminal.
So we are going to approximate this clicking simply by asking the user
for a coordinate of where they want to place their piece.

And ask Player 2 for their move, printing an O in that place.
