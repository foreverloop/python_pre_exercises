Exercise 26 (and Solution)
Tic Tac Toe Winner

If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

game = [[1, 2, 0],[2, 1, 0],[2, 1, 1]]

where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space,
and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.

Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board,
tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any.
A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal.
Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be one winner.

Here are some more examples to work with:

winner_is_2 = [[2, 2, 0],[2, 1, 0],[2, 1, 1]]
